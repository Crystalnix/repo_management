# Welcome to Repositories Management Project

The project's purposes are to provide a simple and flexible tool(s)
for APT repositories management.

## Reasons

Yep, Debian/Ubuntu repositories contains almost everything ones need,
but there are at last two situation, that can make you to think about
creating your own repository:

* you want to provide your own builds of some applications or libs;
* you're developing an application and want to have a ready-for-use  builds to test them on a couple of machines.

Setting up of APT repository isn't a hard task, but takes a time for a
work you probably don't want to do. So it's time to automate it!
